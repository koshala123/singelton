# singelton
A sample application with singleton design pattern in used.

#What: 
Ensures only one instance of a class exists globally.

#Why: 
Provides a central access point for resources that should only have one instance (like a settings manager or a logging system).

#Example: 
A database connection would be the best example

#Bonus point we are making this thread safe as well.
